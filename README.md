This is an enormously groundbreaking project that will change the world forever.
Run it on your terminal and see how the entire world will be greated with a short and comforting: "Hello World".

To get started you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/ .
As soon as you have Python on your computer, just open your commmand line or terminal and type 'python' and hit enter. (at least on macOS, other
